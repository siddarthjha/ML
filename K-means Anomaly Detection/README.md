#  CLUSTER BASED ANOMALY DETECTION 

**K-means:**
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

* A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

* The K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the     centroids as small as possible.

* The **‘means’** in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.

### WHAT IS ANOMALY DETECTION

Anomaly detection (**aka outlier analysis**) is a step in data mining that identifies data points, events, and/or observations that deviate from a dataset’s normal behavior. Anomalous data can indicate critical incidents, such as a technical glitch, or potential opportunities, for instance a change in consumer behavior. Machine learning is progressively being used to automate anomaly detection.
