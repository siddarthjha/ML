#  CLUSTER BASED ANOMALY DETECTION 

**K-means:**
K-means clustering is one of the simplest and popular unsupervised machine learning algorithms.

A cluster refers to a collection of data points aggregated together because of certain similarities.

The K-means algorithm identifies k number of centroids, and then allocates every data point to the nearest cluster, while keeping the centroids as small as possible.

The **‘means’** in the K-means refers to averaging of the data; that is, finding the centroid.
