## Decision Tree

A decision tree is a flowchart-like structure in which each internal node represents a “test” on an attribute (e.g. whether a coin flip comes up heads or tails), each branch represents the outcome of the test, and each leaf node represents a class label (decision taken after computing all attributes).

* Basically decision tree is a combination of **Regression** and **Classification**.
* It is a **Greedy, Top-down, Recursive Partitioning** approach.
* In this we ask multiple questions based on the dataset and segregate the data in tree like structure.
