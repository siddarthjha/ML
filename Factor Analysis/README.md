## Factor Analysis Model
* It is a technique used to reduce a large number of variables into a fewer number of factors.

* This technique extracts **maximum common variance** from all variables, we can use this score for further analysis.

#### Assumptions

1. No outliers present in data.

2. Sample size should be greater than the size of the factor.

3. There should not be any multi-collinearity.

4. No homoscedasicity(All variables having same variance) between variables.

5. True co-relation between variables amd factors.

##### Understanding bits of code
* Factor 1 has high factor loadings for E1,E2,E3,E4, and E5 (Extraversion)

* Factor 2 has high factor loadings for N1,N2,N3,N4, and N5 (Neuroticism)

* Factor 3 has high factor loadings for C1,C2,C3,C4, and C5 (Conscientiousness)

* Factor 4 has high factor loadings for O1,O2,O3,O4, and O5 (Opennness)

* Factor 5 has high factor loadings for A1,A2,A3,A4, and A5 (Agreeableness)

* Factor 6 has none of the high loagings for any variable and is not easily interpretable. Its good if we take only five factors.

**"Factor analysis** explores large dataset and finds interlinked associations. It reduces the observed variables into a few unobserved variables or identifies the groups of inter-related variables, which help the market researchers to compress the market situations and find the hidden relationship among consumer taste, preference, and cultural influence. Also, It helps in improve questionnaire in for future surveys. Factors make for more natural data interpretation."
