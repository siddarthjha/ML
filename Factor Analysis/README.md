## Factor Analysis Model
* It is a technique used to reduce a large number of variables into a fewer number of factors.

* This technique extracts **maximum common variance** from all variables, we can use this score for further analysis.

#### Assumptions

1. No outliers present in data.

2. Sample size should be greater than the size of the factor.

3. There should not be any multi-collinearity.

4. No homoscedasicity(All variables having same variance) between variables.

5. True co-relation between variables amd factors.
