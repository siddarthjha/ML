## Problem Concept Analysis
It is a tecnique for feature extraction.
* It combines our input variables in a specific way, then we can drop the least important variables, while retaining the most valuable parts of all of the variables.
* New variables after PCA are all independent of one another.
* Using PCA, it will make variables less interpretable.

**Steps**
Before starting, you should have tabular data organized with n rows and likely p+1 columns, where one column corresponds to your dependent variable (usually denoted Y) and p columns where each corresponds to an independent variable (the matrix of which is usually denoted X).
