**Please download the dataset from the below given link**

[Olympic athlete history events](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results/discussion)

**Note:** The analysis is done on "athlete_events.csv"

Before jumping to **Data Analysis** we must undergo **Data Pre-processing**.

### Data Pre-Processing
* **Data Cleaning**
  * Data is incomplete - lacking attribute values(NULL).
  * Data is noisy containing errors and outliers.
  * Dat is inconsistent
* **Missing Data**
  * Data is not always available.
  * Inconsistent with other recorded data and deleted.
  * Data may not be entered due to misunderstanding.
* **Handle Data**
  * Filling the missing vlaues.
  * Use of a global constant to fill.
  * Attribute mean and attribute belonging to same class.
* **Data Integration**
  * This is not applicable in all cases.
  * Combines data from multiple sources into a coherent store.
  * Detecting and resolving data value conflicts due to data integration
* **Data Transformation**
  * This step is also not applicable always, depends on the dataset.
  * Normalization.
  * Aggregation.
* **Data Reduction**
  * This step is also depends on the data.
  * If you have multiple features and and want to make it less.
  * PCA.
  * Dimensionality reduction.

And these are all the pre-processing you can do before going to analysis.

**Data analysis** is defined as a process of cleaning, transforming, and modeling data to discover useful information for business decision-making. The purpose of Data Analysis is to extract useful information from data and taking the decision based upon the data analysis.

### Different types of Analysis:
* Exploratory Analysis.
* Distribution Analysis.
* Categorical variable Analysis.
* Statistical Analysis.
